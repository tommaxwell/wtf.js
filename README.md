WTF.js 0.0.9
=====

Sets up easy-to-use Javascript inheritance for any project

Documentation to come in an upcoming push

In order to use WTF.js you will need to include Underscore.js (http://www.underscorejs.org)

I have to especially thank the people of the awesome BackboneJS project (http://www.backbonejs.org). My code is a distillation of the inheritance aspect of their framework, with some of my own tweaks added in.
